    "Write a Python code fragment in the code cell below that defines a function named `play_guess_number` that plays “guess the number” game. The function will choose the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000. Do not reveal this number to the user. Display the prompt \"Guess my number between 1 and 1000 with the fewest guesses:\". The player inputs a first guess. If the guess is incorrect, display \"Too high. Try again.\" or \"Too low. Try again.\" as appropriate to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer, then prompt the user for the next guess. When the user enters the correct answer, display \"Congratulations. You guessed the number!\" Test your game function by putting it in a while loop that will prompt the user to \"Play again (y/n)?\" Continue playing guess the number games as long as the user enters \"y\" or \"Y\" in response. (15 pts.)\n",
